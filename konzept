What makes ACAMN different from other music notation systems is that ACAMN is rather a set of global music-notationally logical rules, than a ready-to-use software. It's aim is providing these logics of music notation rather than forcing music notational algorithms. Although the rules adhere to a great extent to the specifications of EG BB, acamn does not hesitate to express them in form of a more global algorithm, whenever the specifications of BB seem to be constrained to a certain type of music notation tradition (Western music). E.g. he says not: if you give me the note (f () 5) i put it there for you, but this is the logic i am using for determining the position/shape of the notehead, now you might go on and change or breake those logics.
The expressivity of Lisp made it an appearent best choice for implementing these rules...

Problems of integerating traditional engraving practices into a modern
software:
* Spacing symbols (BB p.41). But what about flexible onset
times, e.g. a note is NEGATIVE TIME after it's previous note.

Clefs (unter anderem) sind nur einfache Hashtables die definierte Rules beinhalten. Diese hashtables können um neue Rules belibieg erweitert werden.

CWIM adheres roughly to the specifications of Behind Bars.

Z is musically the most intelligent CONTEXT MANAGER AGENT of CWIM. Z
has read Behind Bars carefuly! I.e. it knows about all pre-defined
structurs (protocols) and aims at giving best (overlapping-)
positioning solutions in terms of the nature of those structurs.

Z differentiates between (musically) IDENTIFIABLE and UNIDENTIFIABLE
overlappings! Example for an identifiable overlapping is (Z staff
clef), basically anything on a staff. Since combination of staff +
clef gives each staff space and line a particular meaning, this will
create a context for working with 12 tones and classifies the note to
one of those spaces.  Z knows about many musically identifiable
structures and puts them i a musically meaningful order: (Z staff note
staccato dynamic-pp) => pp staccato note on a staff, as is expected by
AN EDUCATED MUSICIAN!

More specifically Z cares about (the order of importance is roughly
the same as Behind Bars/Ground Rules):

1. Staff structure:

Z also recognizes identifiable musical elements inside other included
context managers, e.g. (Z (staff) (Y (note) (horizontal-line) (note)))
will put notes on corresponding staff lines (draws renaissance range
at begin of a system).

Y is a vertical stack of structures and/or other context-managers. As
it is a vertical stack it is needed to specify which component is the
vertical reference point (ABSY-TARGET-INDEX), by default it is the first
component in the stack.  Same applies to horizontal alignment of Y's
content: Y takes an ABSX argument and an ABSX-TARGET-INDEX argument (by
default it is the component with the LARGEST WIDTH). ABSX is then
applied to that component, all other items are by default centered
around the middle point of that item.


X takes ABSX: this will become the ABSX of it's first component. All
of the following ABSXs of any further components is (by default)
computed based on the WIDTHs of their foregoing components. As X is a
horizontal stack, it could be specified to which component the ABSX
refers to, this component will be placed at the specified x coordinate
and everything else is computed based on that. It will be possible to
use ABSX or RELX to adjust the horizontal positioning at any time
(RELX will always change the horizontal alignment based on the
computed ABSX). Using an ABSX on an inner-component will cancel out
all X computations. Consider using RELX instead, as it will build upon
X calculations.

X components are processed sequentially.

|X _____

With nesting context managers the following applies:

Z expands and treats the content of enclosed context managers as it's
own content, i.e. Z expands the CMs and tries to bring them into a
musical order.
If X or Y are nested inside a Z, Z needs the index of the component for musical interpretation
