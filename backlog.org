* TODO objects are not replacable:
not providing objects copies, so I can't use a same obj on
multiple places. This can be done by adding a slot clonable?, which indicates
whether the objects is to be used itself (nil, default) or is to be
used as a model from which other objs are cloned.
* TODO svglst content cant be modifed
(even at rule-application-time), svglsts are packed after rules have
been applied, everything then goes for rendering.
